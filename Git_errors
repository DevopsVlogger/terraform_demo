Fixing Git error “GH001: Large files detected"

When you get errors such as ->
remote: error: GH001: Large files detected. You may want to try Git Large File Storage - https://git-lfs.github.com.
remote: error: Trace: f7c3c21d608c253f334ca22d52582393

The problem is that you can’t simply remove the file because it is tracked inside the previous commits so you have to remove this file completely from my repo.

Execute following command to fix the issue ->

$ git filter-branch -f --index-filter 'git rm -r --cached --ignore-unmatch file_or_dir_name'

At which point you can push the file to GitHub.
